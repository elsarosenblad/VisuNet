\title{Rule set from the classifier of autisic and non-autiscic young males}
\format{A data frame with 191 rows and 5 variables. Each row corresponds to one rule:
\describe{
  \item{features}{comma-separated conditions (feature=value)}
  \item{decision}{a rule decision}
  \item{accuracyRHS}{a rule accuracy value}
  \item{supportRHS}{a rule support value}

\description{
The rule-based classifier was created for the gene expression levels of 82 autistic and 64 non-autistic (control) male children.
The data has been preprocessed and the 35 most corellated genes were selected (see \href{https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/625905v1.full}{Garbulowski et al. (2019)})
The rule set was obtained using the rule-based classifier created by a \code{\link[R.ROSETTA]{rosetta}} function from the \pkg{R.ROSETTA} package.
