\title{VisuNet: an interactive tool for network visualization of rule-based models in R}
\usage{
visunet(ruleSet, type = "RDF", NodeColorType = "DL",
  CustObjectNodes = list(), CustObjectEdges = list())
}
\arguments{
\item{ruleSet}{the appropriately formatted set of rules:
\itemize{
\item R.ROSETTA data frame - the rules data frame that is the output of R.ROSETTA can be directly imported in VisuNet.
See \code{\link[R.ROSETTA]{rosetta}} for details.
\item "Line by line" file format - input data should be in a data frame format that contains the following columns:
\itemize{
\item features - the left-hand side of the rule corresponding to comma-separated attributes and their values, of type, type ‘factor’
\item decision - the right-hand side of the rule corresponding to the decision value, of type ‘factor’
\item accuracyRHS - the rule accuracy, of type ‘numeric’
\item supportRHS - the rule support, of type ’numeric
}
}}

\item{type}{a character string specifying the type of the input data:
\itemize{
\item "RDF" - the R.ROSETTA output (see \code{\link[R.ROSETTA]{rosetta}})
\item "L" - the "Line by line" file format (see \code{\link[R.ROSETTA]{saveLineByLine}})
}}

\item{NodeColorType}{a character string specifying the color of nodes:
\itemize{
  \item "DL" - feature discretization levels, option is available for data discretized into three levels: 1, 2 and 3.
  In the case of gene expression, data discretization levels correspond to: 1 - under-expressed gene, 2 - no change gene expression and 3 - over-expressed gene.
  \item "A" - color of nodes defined by the mean accuracy value for the node.
}
The default is "DL".}

\item{CustObjectNodes}{a list that contains the customized VisuNet output for nodes. The list needs to contain two variables:
\itemize{
  \item nodes - a customized VisuNet output for nodes
  \item CustCol - the names of variables added/changed in the VisuNet output for nodes.
  See \code{\link[visNetwork]{visNodes}} for details.
}}

\item{CustObjectEdges}{a list that contains customized VisuNet output for edges.
The list needs to contain two variables:
\itemize{
  \item edges - a customized VisuNet output for edges
  \item CustCol - the names of variables added/changed in the VisuNet output for edges.
  See \code{\link[visNetwork]{visEdges}} for details.
}}
}
\value{
Rule Network Object - a collection of lists corresponding to decision variables and an additional list for the combined decision ‘all’.
The lists contain information required to reproduce the rule network, i.e. data frames for nodes, edges
and RulesSetPerNode - a list that shows rules for each node.
\cr
\cr
Structure of the data frame for nodes:
\itemize{
\item id - a unique node id, based on attribute value and left-hand side value of the rule set
\item label - the attribute variable without the ‘=value’ part from the left-hand side of the rule set
\item DiscState - the attribute value
\item color.background - the node color
\item value - the node size
\item color.border - the color of the node border
\item meanAcc - the mean accuracy value of all rules that contain the node
\item meanSupp - the mean support value of all rules that contain the node
\item NRules - the number of rules that contain the node
\item PrecRules - fraction of rules that contain the node
\item NodeConnection - the total connection value obtained from the rules that contain the node
\item title - information visible on the tooltip
\item group - the decision value that occurs most frequently (>50%) in rules associated with the node;
otherwise group contains all comma-separated decision values corresponding to rules associated with the node.
group defines the content of the ‘Select by decision’ drop-down box.
}

\cr
Structure of the data frame for edges:
\itemize{
\item from, to - the pair of nodes that create the edge
\item conn - the connection variable obtained from the edge-associated rules.
\item connNorm - the connection variable normalized according to the maximum connection variable in the rule network
\item label2 - the edge id
\item color - the edge color
\item title - information visible on the tooltip
\item width - the edge width, defined according to the normalized connection value
