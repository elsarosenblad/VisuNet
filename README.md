*** 
VisuNet is an interactive tool for network visualization of complex rule-based classifiers. VisuNet can be applied to any classification problem and is commonly used with complex health-related decision tasks. The rule networks produced can clearly identify driving genes (metabolites, methylation sites, etc) and their expression levels. 

VisuNet is implemented in R and uses the  [Shiny Gadgets](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/gadgets.html) attributes. The tool includes construction, filtration, visualization and customization of networks from rule-based models.
