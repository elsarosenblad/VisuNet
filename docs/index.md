VisuNet can be successfully apply to any classification problems, such as, for instance, a complex health-related decsion tasks. Rule networks can clearly identify main genes and their expression levels predicting complex phenotypes, e.g. cancer, autism. 
VisuNet is implemented in R and uses the Shiny Gadgets attributes. The tool includes the rule network construction, filtration, visualization and customization.
