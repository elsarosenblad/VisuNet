VisuNet is an interactive tool that supports analysis of complex-rule based classifiers and helps explain their structure. VisuNet is implemented in R and uses the Shiny Gadgets attributes. The tool includes the rule network construction, visualization and customization.
VisuNet can be successfully apply to any 

However, classification problems, such as, for instance,
 AA
identification of main genes and their expression levels predicting complex phenotypes often result in a large number of rules and thus make explainability less obvious. 
The network clearly identifies different combinations of genes and their
expression levels that are associated
